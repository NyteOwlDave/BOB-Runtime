# Tools

Bob itself is just the ray tracer. Yet it comes with a variety
of tools intended to simplify various tasks.

The tools have their own repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NyteOwlDave/BOB-Tools.git
```

This is a collection of scripts and binary executables written
in a variety of languages.

This folder does not contain source code or build information.
It contains only the most recent stable build of those tools.
