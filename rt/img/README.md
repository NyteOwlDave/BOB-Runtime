# Image Folder

The `img` folder contains textures in the native IMG file format for
Bob consumption.

By default, Bob both requires as input IMG files and produces them as output.

There is a tool named `chum` that can convert these files to more
common formats (e.g. PNG, BMP and PPM).

# File Formats

The Bob help system contains detailed information about file formats
and tools.
